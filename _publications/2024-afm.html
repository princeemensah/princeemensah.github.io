We present foundation language models developed to power Apple Intelligence
features, including a ~3 billion parameter model designed to run efficiently on
devices and a large server-based language model designed for Private Cloud
Compute. These models are designed to perform a wide range of tasks efficiently,
accurately, and responsibly. This report describes the model architecture, the
data used to train the model, the training process, how the models are optimized
for inference, and the evaluation results. We highlight our focus on Responsible
AI and how the principles are applied throughout the model development.

This paper provides technical details for Apple's On-Device and Server Foundation
Models, introduced on June 10, 2024, in [this post](https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/introducing-apple-foundation-models).
